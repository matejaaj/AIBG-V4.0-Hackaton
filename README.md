### Introduction

This project aims to develop an AI bot that competes in AlienWarz by optimizing its actions to score the highest points. Note: The code is somewhat messy due to the 24-hour time constraint we had to complete the project.

### Overview

#### Objective

- **Resource Mining:** Efficiently mine and collect resources.
- **Factory Attacks:** Locate and destroy enemy factories.
- **Resource Management:** Convert resources into points and benefits.

#### Approach

- **Game State Analysis:** Parse and analyze the current game state.
- **Pathfinding:** Use breadth-first search to navigate the board.
- **Decision-Making:** Heuristic evaluations for resource prioritization and strategic actions.

#### Key Features

- **Dynamic Strategy:** Adjusts strategies based on game state and opponent behavior.
- **Resource Conversion:** Maximizes points through smart resource management.

### Future Work

Given more time, we would like to improve the bot by incorporating reinforcement learning algorithms to enhance its decision-making and adaptability. This was not possible within the initial 24-hour development window.
